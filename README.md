# StockAnalysis
Seven algorithms were implemented on different datasets of varying sizes (1200 to 10000). 
The algorithms were Linear Regression, KNN, Moving Average, SVM(SVR), Random Forest, AUTO ARIMA, and LSTM. 
The comparison was based on the predictions and RMSE values computed by the different algorithms. 
Graphs were plotted for the different algorithms, each on a different dataset. 
Two additional graphs were plotted to show how the predictions differ for different algorithms on the same dataset.
